# PolicyPulse  
**Macro Policy Impact Analysis Using Python**

PolicyPulse is a data-driven analytics project that examines how global financial markets respond to **central bank policy announcements**, with a focus on interest rate decisions and monetary policy communication.

The project combines **macroeconomic analysis, financial market data, and natural language processing** to quantify sentiment, measure sector-level reactions, and visualize market behavior around policy events.

---

## Motivation
Central bank decisions often move markets within minutes, yet the drivers behind these reactions are complex. PolicyPulse was built to answer:

- How do markets react **before and after** policy announcements?
- Does the **tone and sentiment** of central bank communication matter?
- Which sectors are most sensitive to monetary policy shifts?

## Key Features
- 📊 **Event Study Framework**  
  Measures abnormal returns and volatility around policy announcement windows.

- 🧠 **Policy Statement Sentiment Analysis**  
  Uses NLP techniques to quantify sentiment from central bank statements.

- 🏦 **Sector-Level Market Response**  
  Analyzes ETF and index reactions across different economic sectors.

- 📈 **Interactive Visualizations**  
  Dynamic charts and dashboards for intuitive exploration of results.

- 🌐 **Streamlit Web Application**
